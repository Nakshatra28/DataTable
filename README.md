📊 React Datatable App

This is a small project I built using React.js and Tailwind CSS.
It shows a table of user data where you can:

🔍 Search users by name, email, or gender

📑 Switch between pages with pagination

⚙️ Choose how many rows to show per page (10, 50, 100, 500)

🎨 Enjoy a clean and modern UI

I made this to practice React hooks, pagination logic, and Tailwind styling. Right now, the data comes from a static file, but later it can be connected to an API for live data.
